<h1>Heuristic Evaluation </h1>
<h2>`Heuristics Evaluation 10 Steps with examples` 
> Class (__Developing Professional__) I hope you are fine and don't get panic  from these ten steps. Below I just mention the steps and the examples where you can easily get an idea about how to evaluate any website app and even any product. 

1. ##Visibility of system status: or "what is going on?"
> ### Details : 
The System should always keep  the user informed about what is going on through appropriate feedback
within  reasonable time.
###Example:
Lamp is on or off light appear on.

2. ##Match betweeen system and the real world: or " What are you talking about"
> ### Details:
The system should speak the user lanuage, with words and concept that are familiar to the user.
### Example:
If we look at children book the cartoons show what is it and can understand easily. The user can 
understand easily. Make sure user understands what you're talking about.

3. ##User control and freedom: or "oops"
> ### Details:
Users make mistakes and need an "emergency exit" to get back to where want to be, as fast as possible.
### Example:
Look at tv you can see remote has previous button to revert to your channel. Similarly, the home button 
you can see in websites or apps. Look at your cell phones you also have home button to exit abruptly.
-Always make sure that your system has a simple and efficient  emergency exit to "fix" user error.

4. ##Consistency and standards: or "Oh, I know that"
> ### Details:
User don't have to wonder what these words are. The situtation just create for user to understandly easily user
already know about that. 
### Example:
Look at public resturent which is for mans and womans. As the symbols are conventions.
-Always make sure your system have continuity across your platorm. 

5. ##Error prevention:  or "Glad I didn't do that!"
> ### Details:
The best design don't only have great error recvery, but prevent users from making those error.
### Example: If you look at car dashboard. Excellent error prevention. The car dashboard will tell what is wronge with car.
User can easily recodnise error. Engine is about to over heat. Fan is not working, Gas is going to end.
-Always make sure that your system has efficient error prevention.

6. ##Recongnition or Recall: or "Wait, what was that already?"
> ### Details:
System should minimize  the user's memory load by making objects, actions and options more visible.
User don't have to remember information but recall that object and actions to resume the work.
### Example:
If you look at google  search tool you can easily recognise. When you search once a sentance it will store in cookies for next search. When you type again Google give you suggestion sentance one of them you previous one. Smart search.
-Always make sure that your system prioritizes recognition over recall, whenever appropriate.


7. ##Felxibility and Efficienciy of Use: or "It doesn't matter if you are an Expert  or a newbie"
> ### Details:
System should incorporate accelators, which are unseen to the novice user, but that allow the expert user navigate faster with frequent actions. 
### Example:
If you see Abode photoshope you can easily pick tools to design your object. Or you you can use short cuts keyboard 
to access tools quickly.  
-Always make sure that your system incorporates acceslators to facilitate expert users without affecting noice users.

8. ##Aesthetic and Minimalist Design: or "Wow and WOAH!"
> ### Details: 
Dialogues should not contain irrelavent information. Design should be minimal as possible. Deminish the visiblity.
The efficient as possible
### Example:
If you look at apple remote you can see its too simple and after using it you will say wow it works so perfectly.
-Always make sure your system is Aestheticly pleasent and Efficiently composed.


9. ##Help Users Recognize, Diagnose and Recover from Errors: or "My Bad"
> ### Details:
Errors messages should be expressed in plan languages, and precisely indicate the problem.
### Example:
Well if you look at pencil if tip breaks user can clearly understand what is wronge and what can be done.
-Always make sure your system indicates errors and messages in plain lanuage.

10. ##Help and Documentation : or "Now I get it!"
> ### Details:
Even though the system can use without documentation, it may be necessary to  provide it.
### Example:
You already our daily life devices and componets those can be just readjust each component with each to make full fledge device or component. Do you know about folding bed,sofa, bike and machine. You can compress them easily and reopen them again.
You may be aware about folding stairs! right?
-Always make sure your system provides documentation to help the user.
